# Car-Trading-Information-Management-System

This project developed to complete my B.Sc. Engg. In CSE degree for the course Thesis/Project, CSE 498 at Bangladesh University of Business & Technology (BUBT). In this project, I tried to apply all the knowledge I acquired from software engineering related courses as much as possible.

## Getting Started

This is actually an ERP solutioin designed by targeting car traders in Bangladesh to operate their business faster, smarter and better way. To identify exact demand of the targeted users, I investigate the current system by visiting several shops, interviewing with traders and so on. I carefully studied all possible stakeholders to make the solution possibly more effective, feasible and optimistic. The key deliverables of the project is,

### Desktop Application

The desktop application performs all the possible managerial activities like managing inventory, sales, managing stuﬀs, accounts etc. and so on. In this version, the desktop application is more realistic, eﬀective and eﬃcient than previous versions.<br/>
Several analytics, reporting and printing tools has been added. In this version, we build this desktop application as more maintainable, reliable and reusable to assure a better quality product.

### Web Site 

The web site displays actually all the public information of car shop what exactly visitors supposed to know. The web application also connected with the same database which also connected with the desktop application. In this website, all the features and pages are implemented carefully according to car trading, stakeholders’ acceptability and so on. No extra activities added due to budget issue. The web site will remain a smart way for direct interaction between customer and car trader.<br/>
Both deliverables accessing same centralized database.

## Methodology

To develop this project, I choose Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD). OOAD is better to use in this kind of project where continuous maintenance is required and this is the major reason for which I choose it. It can be assume that, in future, it will give more benefit because of the increasing use and demand of UML.

## Design

According to the methodology OOAD, I designed all possible diagrams. All these diagrams are stored in the [Design Diagrams]( https://github.com/Lios82/Car-Trading-Information-Management-System/tree/master/Design%20Diagrams). Here I designed every diagram component wise.

## Implementation

This solution is actually a combination of desktop application and website. The database is primarily stored as a Sevice Based Database, also known as local database. It has targeted to store database on remote machine during real time use, but in this case, because of some financial issues, it stored in local machine. Here the code is much flexible to use database stored in remote machine.<br/>
The desktop application built by using C# WPF in MVVM architectural pattern. Whereas the desktop application contains major managerial operations of the system, I tried to code possibly reusable, readable and maintainable during this short time of submission. The website built by using .NET Framework with MVC architectural pattern.
